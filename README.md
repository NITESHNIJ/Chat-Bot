# Chat-Bot

The chatbot was made by me during my summer internship at IIT Kanpur, India.

The chatbot is different from any other working chatbots that we see in our day to day lifes.
This chatbot does not uses any complex concepts of Artificila Intelligence, it is rather made by using pre Deep Learning Approaches into consideration.

The chatbot is a mixture of concepts of Pre-Deep Learning and Post Deep Learning.

We use word embeddings to get the meaning of every word in the question and then companre them to the pre-saved questions dictionary, by the method of cross multiplication.

We then return the answer corresponding to the question which makes the closest match to the asked question.
